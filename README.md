# Encoding samples

Markdown documents saved with different encodings that contain specific character tables and text examples. Use them to test encoding/decoding algorithms. Each document is also saved in generally accepted UTF-8 encoding so you can test conversion by loading both versions and comparing resulting strings.

## Encodings

- KOI8-R
- KOI8-RU
- KOI8-T
- KOI8-U
- Windows-1251
- Windows-1252
- more to add...

Additional binary file contains all possible bytes from `0` to `255` to test loading file as binary string.
